# {{PROBLEM}} Web Design Recipe (Level Three)

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user stories here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Interface

_This is the fun part! Use excalidraw.com or a similar tool to design some
wireframes (rough sketches of the user interface). Include interactions and
transitions between pages — those are the most critical part._

## 3. Design the Database

_Design the data tables that will store all of the information your application
manages. Include the data types and examples of three rows. Consider use Google
Sheets or [AsciiTable](https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/) to do this._


## 4. Create Examples of User Interactions

_Create examples of user interactions and expectations._

```ruby
# As you learn the testing tools you might start writing with realistic test
# code here, but at the start it's OK if it's just English or made up code.

```

## 6. Test-Drive the Behaviour

_Follow this cycle:_

1. Add a feature test in `/spec/feature/` (RED)
2. Implement the behaviour in `app.rb`
3. Does it pass without data model changes? (GREEN) Then skip to step 6.
4. Otherwise, add a unit test for the data model to `/spec/unit` (RED)
5. Implement the behaviour in your data model class. (GREEN)
6. Apply any refactors to improve the structure of the code. (REFACTOR)  
   Run `rubocop` as part of this.
7. Go back to step 1.
